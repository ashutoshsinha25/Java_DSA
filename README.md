# Introduction
Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for writing efficient and scalable code. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of problems that cover a wide range of data structures and algorithms concepts, along with their implementations in Java.

# Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: 
2. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) if you haven't already. You can download it from Oracle's website or use your preferred package manager.
3. Open your favorite Java IDE or editor.
4. Explore the repository's directory structure to find the data structures and algorithms you're interested in.

# Data Structures
The repository covers various data structures such as:

1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists
3. Stacks
4. Queues
5. Trees
6. Graphs
7. Hash Tables
8. Heaps
9. and more...
Each data structure has its dedicated directory containing implementation files and example usage. Feel free to explore and study the provided code.

# Algorithms
The repository includes implementations of fundamental algorithms, including but not limited to:

1. Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
2. Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
3. Graph algorithms (e.g., Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
4. Dynamic Programming algorithms
5. and more...
Just like the data structures, each algorithm has its dedicated directory with implementation files and example usage.

# Contributing
